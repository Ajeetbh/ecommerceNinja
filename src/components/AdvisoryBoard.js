      <h1>Advisory Board Charter</h1>
      <p>Ninjacart seeks to organize and empower all participants in the agriculture value chain by leveraging technology and data. We are operating in an extremely complex ecosystem, comprising millions of stakeholders, from farmers to retailers.

       Obviously, the needs of such a large and diverse set of participants would be manifold and diverse. Professionals from different sectors have been working on solving these problems, and we felt that their experience and input would be of utmost value in our endeavour. Towards this goal, we have constituted an advisory board which will offer guidance leveraging their expertise in the fields of agriculture, public policy, finance, platform theory, and technology. In our pursuit of creating value for all the players in the Agri-ecosystem, their guidance will be vital.

      The advisory boardâ€™s members are professionals who come with decades of experience in diverse fields. They bring unparalleled expertise in the fields of Agri supply chain, rural financing, platform design, and fintech. Their perspectives on our strategic initiatives would be of immense value in digitally orchestrating the different value chain players towards a more efficient value chain functioning. It will also serve as a forum for our leadership team to get critical input on the approach to solving these problems and reaching out to the relevant stakeholders.
